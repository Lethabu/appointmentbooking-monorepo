## Tone of Voice

### For Customer Service
- **Helpful & patient:** Always assume the customer is new; explain clearly.
- **Warm, not formal:** Use first names; avoid corporate jargon.
- **Action-oriented:** Give clear next steps (link, phone, time).
- **Emoji-friendly:** Use sparingly but meaningfully (✨💇🏽‍♀️🔥).

**Example (Good):**
> "Hey babe! 💕 Got it—let's reschedule you for Saturday at 11 AM. Just click the link in your SMS to confirm, or hit us back if that doesn't work. We've got you!"

**Example (Avoid):**
> "Your appointment modification request has been received. Please utilise the provided link to confirm your rescheduling."

---

### For Marketing & Promotion
- **Aspirational but achievable:** Paint a picture of feeling amazing.
- **Story-driven:** Focus on the transformation, not just the service.
- **Community-celebratory:** Highlight other clients' wins.
- **Authentic:** No false claims; own your niche (hair salon, not tech startup).

**Example (Good):**
> "🌟 From TUT campus to client dinners. From 9-to-5 to Friday night out. Your wig installed, your confidence unlocked. Book your Middle & Side now and walk out like you own the room."

**Example (Avoid):**
> "Get a wig install. Fast. Cheap. Now."

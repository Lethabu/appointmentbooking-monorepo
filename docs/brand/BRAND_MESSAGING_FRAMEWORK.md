## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK

### "We already have a booking system"

**Response**: "Many of our most successful clients felt the same way. The question is: is your current system helping you increase revenue by 40%? Most generic systems are just digital calendars. Our platform is designed specifically to grow beauty businesses."

### "It's too expensive"

**Response**: "Consider this: if our platform helps you increase revenue by just 20% (our conservative estimate), the monthly cost pays for itself many times over. Plus, you'll save 10+ hours weekly that you can reinvest in growing your business."

### "What if it doesn't work for our business?"

**Response**: "We understand that concern, which is why we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. But here's what makes us confident: we're not just a booking system - we're your growth partner. Our success team works with you to ensure you're getting the results you need."

### "Our clients are used to calling to book"

**Response**: "That's actually perfect - it means you have loyal customers who trust your service. Our platform makes it even easier for them to book (and rebook), while giving you more time to focus on delivering exceptional experiences rather than managing phone calls."

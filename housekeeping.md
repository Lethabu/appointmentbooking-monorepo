# Project Housekeeping

This file lists files and directories that are obsolete or no longer in use and should be removed.

## Files and Directories to Remove

- **`apps/marketing/next.config.ts.bak`**: This is an unused backup file for the Next.js configuration and can be safely deleted.

- **`apps/booking/supabase`**: This directory and its contents appear to be from a previous implementation using Supabase. The project has since migrated to Cloudflare D1 for its database, making this directory obsolete. Removing it will help to avoid confusion for future development.
